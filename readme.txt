The easiest way to manage the intra-community VAT of your customers in your store

== Description ==

The easiest way to manage the intra-community VAT of your customers in your store. Just install it, and the vat number field will appear to customers who indicate their billing address in some of the countries of the European community (except the country of your store).

The system will automatically validate if the number entered is a valid number using the VIES system with package [vies](https://github.com/DragonBe/vies) by [DragonBe](https://github.com/DragonBe). If it is valid, that customer will be able to place their order tax-free.

The vat number field will appear in 3 places:

* In the user profile in the administration part
* On the Woocommerce my-account page. In the billing address part.
* On the checkout page
